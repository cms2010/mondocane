	<div>Together Greg Wooten and Patrick Parrish formed Mondo Cane in 1994 at the Michigan Modernism show in Detroit. Since then, they have been regular exhibitors at Modernism events in New York, Miami and Palm Springs and Los Angeles.</div>
	<div class="space">In September 2000 they opened their first shop in Chelsea. By 2004 Mondo Cane had outgrown its Chelsea location and the partners decided to move the gallery to 174 Duane Street in Tribeca.</div>
	<div class="space">Working with architect William Massie, they were able to create an interesting environment to display their particular vision of the period 1880–1980. Major designers, architects and artists are represented along with what might be Mondo Cane’s strongest point—lesser known and anonymous artisans and designers.</div>
	<div class="space">The shop’s inventory and design lean toward the unusual and unpredictable.</div>
